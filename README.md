# ProDev Backend Engineering Program

## Overview

This repository contains my final project for the **ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program**. The journey through this program has been both challenging and rewarding, equipping me with the skills and mindset needed to build reliable, scalable backend systems.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies

* **Python** – My primary tool for backend logic and problem solving
* **Django** – Framework I used to build structured, production-ready APIs
* **REST APIs & GraphQL** – Designing endpoints that are both flexible and efficient
* **Docker** – Simplifying development and deployment across environments
* **CI/CD** – Setting up pipelines for continuous testing and delivery

### Core Concepts

* **Database Design** – Creating schemas that balance performance and integrity
* **Asynchronous Programming** – Improving responsiveness with async tasks
* **Caching Strategies** – Reducing database load and speeding up requests

### Challenges & Solutions

* Tackling slow queries → I learned to optimize ORM queries and indexes
* Handling environment configurations → Adopted `django-environ` and containerized secrets
* Scaling APIs → Used caching layers and Celery task queues for efficiency

### Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

* Write clean, modular, and test-driven code
* Always document APIs for ease of use and collaboration
* Security and scalability must be built in from the start
* Continuous learning and adaptability are as important as technical skills
